# Multi-Agent AI Research Assistant  
**Capstone Project – Built in Kaggle**

This project is a multi-agent system built using a Large Language Model (LLM).  
It demonstrates the required concepts from the course, including:

---

## 🚀 Features Included
### ✅ Multi-Agent System
- Research Agent → searches content using tools  
- Summarizer Agent → condenses long text  
- Planner Agent → manages workflow  

### ✅ Tools Used
- Google Search Tool (via serpapi or custom search API)
- Python execution inside Kaggle
- Custom parsing tools  
- Long-running operations and loop agent behavior  

### ✅ Sessions & Memory
- InMemorySessionService  
- Agent context is maintained across steps  

### ✅ Observability
- Logging of each agent step  
- Step-by-step reasoning trace  
- Final combined output

## 📁 Project Structure
## How It Works
1. User enters a research query  
2. Research agent searches the web  
3. Summarizer agent cleans and organizes the content  
4. Planner agent generates the final output (report or answers)  
5. System loops until the task is complete

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Kaggle Notebook  
- LLM-based Agents  
- Custom Tools  
- Multi-agent Workflow  

---

## Output
This agent system can:  
- Do research  
- Collect data  
- Summarize long content  
- Produce clean and structured answers  
- Work as an automated research assistant
